# ParticleSimulator
A small and non-optimized particle simulator

I know this is far from being any optimized.
Just follow the style of the parameters.txt file and run the main.py.
A simulation will run and then you will see the movie.
Working on features like:
- only reproduction
- smart video saving
- make it more beautiful
